    "# Inner workings of lists\n",

    "> We know how Python lists work behind the scenes. In this exercise you'll get some hands-on experience with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Python code in the script already creates a list with the name **`areas`** and a copy named **`areas_copy`**. Next, the first element in the **`areas_copy`** list is changed and the **`areas`** list is printed out. If you Run Code in IPython shell you'll see that, although you've changed **`areas_copy`**, the change also takes effect in the **`areas`** list. That's because **`areas`** and **`areas_copy`** point to the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you want to prevent changes in **`areas_copy`** from also taking effect in **`areas`**, *you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the areas list*. You can do this with **[list()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list)** or by using **`[:]`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "> Change the second command, that creates the variable `areas_copy`, such that `areas_copy` is an explicit copy of `areas`. \n",
    "After your edit, changes made to `areas_copy` shouldn't affect `areas`. Check this."
